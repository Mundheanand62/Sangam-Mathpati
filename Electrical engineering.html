1.Electrical Control Panel

The electrical control panel is an essential item in industrial electrification.
 It regulates the function of the electrical equipment. Electrical panels fitted with necessary relays are also used to protect electrical equipment from being damaged
 due to short circuit and overloading.

2.Building/Installation of Home Solar Power Generation Equipment

Everyone is seeking to generate as much power as they can. This makes this business feasible and highly enterprising. You can make a lot of them and sell especially if you win a contract.



3.Cathode Ray Tube Production

The Cathode Ray Tube utilizes a big but fragile evacuated glass envelope which is fairly heavy.
 For safety purposes, the tube comes in a thick lead glass in order to make it shatter-resistant and to prevent most X-ray emissions, 
most especially when the Cathode Ray Tube is made for a consumer product. You can begin the production of cathode Ray tubes with little capital.


4.Production of Cooling Solution

The cooling solution market keeps growing on a yearly basis. Installation of cooling systems for corporate bodies is highly lucrative.
 Corporate bodies are seeking to make their environment more conducive for business and this makes them request cooling system installation.


5.Repair and Maintenance Services

Electrical Engineers understand how electronic equipment and cars function. 
Those who need repair services need their knowledge and expertise to put their electronic device in order and for maintenance purposes. 
For example, an electrical engineer who is an expert in aircraft may promote his services to airplane mechanics.</PRE>
