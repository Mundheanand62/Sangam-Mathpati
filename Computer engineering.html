1.Computer Tutor/Trainer Business

Just because we live in a computer age doesn't mean everyone is computer-savvy. That's where the computer tutor or trainer comes in.
 A home based computer tutor teaches individuals and/or businesses how to best use their computer programs and the Internet.
 In many cases, you'll visit the client in their home or office, unless the client needs help with a laptop or tablet, in which case you can meet anywhere. 

Your clients can be diverse, from children to seniors, and everyone in between.
 You might be hired by businesses that need help learning specific programs or computer-related tasks, such as setting up a database or creating spreadsheets.

You can even work with groups, training an entire office. Or you can run classes either through your home (if allowed by zoning) or through a local adult education resource such as the senior center.

Tutoring does require patience, especially since technology has it's own set of terms that many don't know or understand. 



2. Computer Repair Business

Computer repair specialists need to have a deep understanding of the mechanics and programming systems of computers in order to identify and fix problems.
 Individuals and small businesses that don't have a tech team on staff hire computer repair technicians to fix, clean or replace their hardware and software on time, on budget, with a smile.

If you're working from home, you'll likely go to the clients' home or office to work. You'll need to have tools required to diagnose system issues as well as to open a computer to fix or 
replace a hard-drive or other internal device. 

Along with repair, you can offer computer and network set up, including security setup to help keep clients' computer virus and malware-free. 


3.Desktop Publishing Business


If your computer skills include creativity, as well as an understanding of page layout and graphics, desktop publishing is a viable home business idea to consider. 
While there are many DIY programs for desktop publishing, many businesses need customized creations. 
Among the many tasks desktop publishers perform are producing books, newsletters, magazines, brochures, Internet content, and graphic design for logos and signage. 
Many online entrepreneurs need help in creating their products, such as planners, charts and more. 
You might even work for private individuals creating personalized gifts (i.e. photo calendar), announcements or invitations, and other items.
