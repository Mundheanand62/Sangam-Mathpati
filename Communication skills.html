1. Listening
Being a good listener is one of the best ways to be a good communicator. No one likes communicating with someone who only cares about putting in her two cents, 

and does not take the time to listen to the other person. If you're not a good listener, it's going to be hard to comprehend what you're being asked to do.

Take the time to practice active listening. Active listening involves paying close attention to what the other person is saying, asking clarifying questions, 
and rephrasing what the person says to ensure understanding (&quot;So, what you're saying is&hellip;&quot;). Through active listening, you can better understand what the other person is trying to say,
and can respond appropriately.

Types of Listening Skills With Examples
2. Nonverbal Communication
Your body language, eye contact, hand gestures, and tone all color the message you are trying to convey. A relaxed, open stance (arms open, legs relaxed), 
and a friendly tone will make you appear approachable, and will encourage others to speak openly with you.

Eye contact is also important; you want to look the person in the eye to demonstrate that you are focused on the person and the conversation (however, be sure not to stare at the person, 
which can make him or her uncomfortable).

Also pay attention to other people's nonverbal signals while you are talking.

Often, nonverbal signals convey how a person is really feeling. For example, if the person is not looking you in the eye, he or she might be uncomfortable or hiding the truth.

3. Clarity and Concision
Good communication means saying just enough - don't say too little or talk too much. Try to convey your message in as few words as possible. Say what you want clearly and directly, 
whether you're speaking to someone in person, on the phone, or via email. If you ramble on, your listener will either tune you out or will be unsure of exactly what you want.
 Think about what you want to say before you say it; this will help you to avoid talking excessively and/or confusing your audience.

4. Friendliness
Through a friendly tone, a personal question, or simply a smile, you will encourage your coworkers to engage in open and honest communication with you.
 It's important to be nice and polite in all your workplace communications. This is important in both face-to-face and written communication. 
When you can, personalize your emails to coworkers and/or employees - a quick &quot;I hope you all had a good weekend&quot; at the start of an email can personalize a message and make the 
recipient feel more appreciated.

5. Confidence
It is important to be confident in all of your interactions with others. Confidence ensures your coworkers that you believe in and will follow through with what you are saying. 
Exuding confidence can be as simple as making eye contact or using a firm but friendly tone (avoid making statements sound like questions). Of course, be careful not to sound arrogant or aggressive.
 Be sure you are always listening to and empathizing with the other person.
