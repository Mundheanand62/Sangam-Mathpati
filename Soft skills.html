What are Soft Skills?

Whereas hard skills are the tangible and technical skills easily demonstrated by a candidate&rsquo;s qualifications and specific professional experiences, 
soft skills is a term used by employers to refer to the more intangible and non-technical abilities that are sought from candidates.

Soft skills are sometimes referred to as transferable skills or professional skills. As this term implies, these are skills that are less specialised, less rooted in specific vocations, 
and more aligned with the general disposition and personality of a candidate. Examples of important soft skills are communication, teamwork and problem solving.

Soft skills relate to your attitudes and your intuitions. As soft skills are less referable to your qualifications and more personality-driven, 
it is important to consider what your soft skills are and how you might show evidence of them before you apply for a job. 
This is particularly true of the recruitment process for graduate programmes, where transferable skills and potential often take precedence over professional experience.
 Being able to demonstrate your soft skills equates to demonstrating great potential to succeed and progress in the career of your choice.

Why do Soft Skills Matter?

Soft skills are the difference between adequate candidates and ideal candidates. In most competitive job markets, recruitment criteria do not stop at technical ability and specialist knowledge.
 Particularly with graduate schemes, recruiters will be looking for people who can become leaders, and leadership, itself, depends on several key soft skills.

An instructive example of the difference made by soft skills is a medical doctor. A doctor is required to have an extensive repertoire of hard skills, 
especially the ability to diagnose and prescribe treatments for an array of ailments. But a doctor who does not have the soft skills of emotional intelligence, 
trustworthiness and approachability is not likely to be very highly regarded by their patients. Similarly, 
a salesperson who may have an unrivalled and exhaustive knowledge of their market will find it difficult to close a deal and retain their clients
 if they lack the soft skills of interpersonal skills and negotiation.

Soft skills are not just important when facing external customers and clients. They are equally important when it comes to interacting with colleagues. 
Soft skills relate to how you work with others (whereas hard skills relate to you, in isolation, as an individual). Employers value soft skills because they enable people to function and thrive 
in teams and in organisations as a whole. A productive and healthy work environment depends on soft skills. After all, the workplace is an interpersonal space,
 where relationships must be built and fostered, perspectives must be exchanged, and occasionally conflicts must be resolved.</PRE>
