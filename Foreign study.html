This trend has changed in recent years, as easy access to education loans has prompted a rise in the number of students opting to study an undergraduate programme abroad, 
right after they complete their 12th Grade.
Not just full-time undergraduate programmes there are a number of summer school programmes, vocational and technical training courses that can be studied abroad after completing 12th Grade.
