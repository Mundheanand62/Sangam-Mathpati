<PRE CLASS="western">1]Diploma In Mechanical Engineering


Have you been eager to know the brain work that makes those wonderful machines built by humankind move? How does it generate the power to make the perfect movement in different conditions?.

Almost anything that relates to motion &ndash; whether machines or a structure, involves the brain of a mechanical engineer.

A study in mechanical engineering, hence, will equip you with this basic knowledge of movement and the power / energy that is involved, which makes it possible.

scope of study and the flexibility of career choice enjoyed by this field of engineering is unmatched by any other field.

Mechanical engineering study is applied in the design and control of systems and processes involved in &ndash; manufacturing plants, automobiles, aircraft&rsquo;s, machine tools, air-conditioning,
 refrigeration, boilers, power plants, fuel processing etc.,

Diploma in Mechanical Engineering
Do the latest inventions and creative products make you sit up and want to know how they came about? Does a versatile and broad-based engineering course that opens doors to a wide array 
of careers excite you? With the Diploma in Mechanical (ME), you can look forward to creating and designing products for diverse sectors. You will gain a strong foundation and become 
a competent mechanical engineer.
This practice oriented course will provide you with the latest computational skills and technology to be at the forefront of the industry. 
ME&rsquo;s strong emphasis on design empowers you for value-added engineering jobs such as the generation and use of energy, creation of new materials, process design,
 and the manufacture of a wide array of products ranging from home appliances to medical devices.



2]Diploma in Electrical Engineering

Diploma in Electrical Engineering has become the basic need for survival, globally. From household to industrial plants, communication and satellite navigation system, 
electronic equipment, computers etc., all require electricity.

Electrical engineering deals with study and application of electrical systems for use in these different environments.It equips you with the knowledge of transmission and 
generation of electrical power, electrical circuit design, electronics, instrumentation, control system, understanding electrical and electronic networks etc.,

Skills Required

You should have good logical and mental capability coupled with strong analytical skill and attention to detail. They should be able to grasp and adapt to new and changing concepts.





3]Diploma In Civil Engineering



If you have interest in building new structures and wish to ALWAYS have your desired job in hand, civil engineering is your best choice.Civil engineering is all about designing, 
constructing and supervising new and old structures, and as far as human society exists, construction of new buildings, transportation and even sewerage work will exist forever.

Skills

Like in any other engineering field good logical and mental capability, problem solving skills and ability to grasp new concepts are very essential to be a good civil engineer.





4]Diploma In Computer Science


Most of the Technical universities and many private colleges in India also offer Diploma courses in streams like Computer Science. 
These Diploma courses can be 1 month to 3 years of duration and covers basics of computer science like HTML, Hardware, networking, databases to teach programming in languages like Java, 
.net, C/C++.



5]Diploma In Architecture


A keen interest in design and fondness for building beautiful structures coupled with technically creative mind is what it takes to pursue your dream career in architectural engineering.
This field of engineering, unlike civil engineering, which deals with building structures, focuses on the aesthetic / artistic importance and comfort that add value and give distinctiveness to
 the structure as a whole.

It equips you with the technical knowledge of structures, its foundation design and optimum use of space available. 
It teaches you to combine creative design with structural needs of the building. It touches every aspect of building viz. design, materials involved and its components, environmental impact, 
safety and protection etc.,It is also used as an important tool for design of consumer products that would stand out for its aesthetic value and comfort of use.</PRE>
