Importance of Career Guidance

Most students find it difficult to make career decisions once they enter into the 10th or 12th grade. 
Making career decisions are so difficult for students because they aren’t aware of where their interest’s lie and what their abilities are,
 nor are they sure of what they want to become in life which is not their fault either.
These individuals are too young to make important decisions such as choosing a right career path because they do not posses the necessary skills required to make such an important decision.
The reason being that most children today usually vile away their time engaging in unproductive activities that serve as distractions for instance the Internet,
Smart phones and the Television, instead of focusing on matters that are of importance. 
As a consequence most students haven’t tried different things, therefore choosing a career path nowadays is so stressful for both students as well as parents.



Although students do have some idea about the options  available in the market,  
they may not posses complete knowledge about the wide array of options available to them due to the constant change in the job market.
 This constant change in the job market is a result of development giving rise to newer professions. 
In addition to this the sources that pupils use to help them make these decisions are usually their parents, 
who aren’t always aware of the various options available in the market. So they tend to choose a stream that their friends take up, 
without the knowledge of the course that will suite them best. 
This method is usually not a good approach; hence career guidance becomes essential.
