Savitribai Phule Pune University, formerly University of Pune and University of Poona, is a university in Pune in western India, 
founded in 1949. Spread over a 411 acres (1.66 km2) campus,[2] the university is home to 43 academic departments. 
The university is named after Savitribai Phule, a 19th-century Indian social reformer who is known for her contribution towards 
empowerment and emancipation of women through education. The university has affiliated colleges, departments, and research institutes, 
which are primarily in Pune.

History


The University of Poona (original name) was established on 10 February 1949 under the Poona University Act, 
passed by the Bombay legislature in 1948. M. R. Jayakar became its first Vice-Chancellor. B. G. Kher,
 Chief Minister and Education Minister of the government of Bombay, helped ensure the university received a large
 allocation of land for their campus. In early 1950, the university was allocated over 411 acres (1.7 km&sup2;).

Its location has historical significance. Some incidents of the Battle of Khirkee, during the Third Anglo-Maratha War,
 took place where the present-day university is located. The present-day main building was built in 1864 and was known as the Governor's House.
 The university is home to IUCAA, an institute for astronomy.

The institution's name was changed from the University of Pune to Savitribai Phule Pune University on 9 August 2014 in honor of Savitribai Phule, 
the 19th century Indian social reformer who played an important role in improving the lives of women and the Dalit communities in 
Maharashtra during British colonial rule. She and her husband founded Pune's first native run school for girls in 1848.</PRE>
