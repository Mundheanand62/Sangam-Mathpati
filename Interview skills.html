1. Preparation
Winging it is never worth it. Not only will your interviewer see right through it, but your answers (and your self-confidence) will seriously suffer if you neglect to properly prepare. 
You should dedicate an hour, at the minimum, to your preparation.

Here&rsquo;s a sample formula outlining a 60-minute preparation exercise:

5 minutes re-reading and analyzing the job description, focusing on the essential requirements and responsibilities, in order to tailor your answers to focus on the most important aspects of the job.

5 minutes re-reading your resume and cover letter, to review how you pitched yourself in the first place.

15 minutes researching potential interview questions specific to the position, and the industry.

20 minutes practicing answers to these questions, and recalling specific examples from your work experience, such as major accomplishments,
 challenges or milestones that will serve as anecdotes to strengthen your responses to situational and behavioral-based interview questions.

15 minutes researching the company, looking into their history, mission and values, and recent projects.

Indeed, practice makes perfect. In addition to practicing these steps on your own, ask a friend or family member to pose as an interviewer, so you can get used to answering questions in real time.





2. Punctuality
There are very few (if any) excuses that will redeem a late arrival. Do whatever you need to do to get there ten to 15 minutes in advance of your interview time
 whether it&rsquo;s planning your outfit and packing your bag the night before, setting five alarms or asking a friend to give you a wake-up call, or leaving extra early to account 
for potential transportation obstacles.


3. Thinking Before You Speak
A well thought-out answer is always better than a rushed one. Of course, you don&rsquo;t want to sit there in silence for 5 minutes as you come up with an answer, 
but it is acceptable to take several seconds to think before you speak.

Avoid the &ldquo;ums&rdquo; and &ldquo;uhs&rdquo; and buy yourself time by repeating the interviewer&rsquo;s question back to them, or using a phrase like &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an interesting question!&rdquo; 
&ldquo;I was actually just thinking about that when I read an article on a similar topic, and&hellip;&rdquo;

If you&rsquo;re really stumped, you can say, &ldquo;What a great question. I&rsquo;ve actually never been asked this before; let me just take a second to think about this.&rdquo;
 Finally, know what to do if you really can&rsquo;t answer a question.



4. Speaking Clearly, Cohesively, and Calmly
Nerves can get you talking a mile a minute, and so can the simple desire to convey as much valuable information about yourself as possible.

However, talking too fast can make you look rushed, flustered or anxious. Make a conscious effort to slow down and speak calmly and clearly. It will help you avoid interview stress.



5. Being Confident, Not Arrogant
Although you should be willing and able to promote yourself, your experience and accomplishments, make sure you don&rsquo;t come across as arrogant, narcissistic or self-important. 
No matter how good you are at your job, you&rsquo;re going to run into countless obstacles if you lack the emotional intelligence to work on a team and get along with managers, co-workers or clients.

Focus on exuding a kind and balanced sense of confidence, and when you discuss your achievements, be sure to give credit where credit is due in order to show that you&rsquo;re a team player.
