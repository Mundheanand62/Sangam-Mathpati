1.Electronic Toys Making

Electronic toys market of India is largely import oriented. Electronics remote controlled toys are very popular and the manufacturing of this item is financially viable 
as per revenue earning model.


2. Inverter Manufacturing 

An Inverter is a device, which converts DC power into alternative sources. This conversion may accomplish by electromechanical means namely motor, 
Generator sets are entirely by electronics means. Inverters in which power conversion is accomplished by SCRs are called static inverters. 
A static inverter uses transistors as switches. However, you can use only SCRs for high power applications. Inverters find applications where you need an emergency standby power. 


3.LED Light Manufacturing

LED stands for light emitting diode. Actually, LED lights are becoming very popular day-by-day.
 LED lights are available in wide range of colors from 2700K to 6500K which are dark, yellow, mild yellow and ultra white. 
Initiating a full scale LED light manufacturing includes a large-scale factory operation with definitely a complex production process. 
However, any individual can initiate an LED light assembling unit as a small and medium scale manufacturing operation. 



4.Optical Fiber Manufacturing

Optical fibers are the essential items to transmit light between the two ends of the fiber and find wide usage in fiber-optic communications, 
where they permit transmission over longer distances and at higher bandwidths (data rates) than wire cables.
 Basically, you can produce the glass optical fibers from silica. However, you can use other materials, such as fluoro-zirconate, fluoro-aluminate, 
and chalcogenide glasses as well as crystalline materials like sapphire, for longer-wavelength infrared or other specialized applications.
