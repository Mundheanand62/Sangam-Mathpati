Some ideas which come to mind -
Automation of execution to achieve much faster turnaround times in construction projects.
 This is especially applicable to India where construction is painfully slow as compared to the west or even China ( I was amazed to know that construction of a huge structure like Millau Viaduct took
 only 3 years. In India, for such projects, often a year or more can pass even before the full site team and equipment are even mobilized).
A new material to replace concrete or steel or a new structural concept (like prestressing introduced in the past by Eug&egrave;ne Freyssinet) can cause a major disruption. 
But again, significant research is required. A lot of research is already going on in this field though, materials have come up but are not yet feasible to use at a massive scale 
(eg. Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer, Fiber-reinforced concrete). Maybe you can look into some of them for inspiration or further development.
Innovations in engineering and design space, finding new ways to design structures using the tremendous computation power and technology available. 
But unless what you do is truly revolutionary, what you will end up doing is only adding value to an already working product in an industry which does not care too much about value-engineering.
 You can develop tools for existing consultants, but scalability would be a problem there, the market of consultants is simply not large enough. </PRE>
