The University of Tokyo (Tokyo daigaku), abbreviated as Todai (Todai) or UTokyo,[4] is a public research university located in Bunkyo, 
Tokyo, often cited as the most prestigious university in Japan.

History

Faculty of Law building in 1902, before its destruction by the 1923 Great Kanto earthquake
The university was chartered by the Meiji government in 1877 under its current name by amalgamating older government schools for medicine 
and Western learning. It was renamed &quot;the Imperial University (Teikoku daigaku)&quot; in 1886, and then Tokyo Imperial University 
 Tokyo teikoku daigaku) in 1897 
when the Imperial University system was created. In September 1923, an earthquake and the following fires destroyed about 700,000 volumes
 of the Imperial University Library.[7] The books lost included the Hoshino Library ( Hoshino bunko), a collection of about 10,000 books.

In 1947, after Japan's defeat in World War II, it re-assumed its original name. With the start of the new university system in 1949, 
Todai swallowed up the former First Higher School (today's Komaba campus) and the former Tokyo Higher School, which
 thenceforth assumed the duty of teaching first- and second-year undergraduates, while the faculties on Hongo main campus took care of third- 
and fourth-year students.</PRE>
